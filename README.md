# Enigma

+ This is a personal portfolio website made using flutter.

## Getting Started

+ The live hosted version of the website can be found here -> [Link](https://maverick-wolf.github.io/enigma/)

## About

+ The website is completely responsive, which means you can resize the window and the contents of the website will change orientation accordingly, in short works for both mobile and PC.
+ The website uses some animations for improving the UX. 
+ The Website also has some hover effects for the PC orientation.
+ The website uses the [Github Api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to display the various public repositories owned by me.
+ The website also has a Login System through which the Admin(me) can login and add new projects.
